    <h2 class="heading">Contributions to Computer Science:</h2>
    <p class="body-text">Along with John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, William Shockley was the inventor of the transistor, a device that completely revolutionized everything known about computer design.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Prior to his and his colleagues' invention, computers would use vacuum tubes which were large and easy to break. The transistor was small and solid, making it far more durable and far more compact.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Modern-day computer construction still uses the transistor, and miniaturization advances allowed transistors to be crammed even tighter, with a modern-day (2021) CPU boasting an impressive <b>~15-16 billion transistors.</b></p> 
    <br>
    <p class="body-text">William Shockley and his colleagues John Bardeen and Walter Brattain received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1956 for their invention of the transistor.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Timeline</h2>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1910</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">William B. Shockley is born in London England, Feb. 13th, to parents William Hillman Shockley and Mary (née Bradford).</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1928</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley entered the California Institute of Technology, studying physics.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1932</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley graduated from the California Institute of Technology. That same year, he entered the Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1936</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley graduated with the title of Doctor at MIT. He also began to work at <i>Bell Telephone Laboratories</i> the same year.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1939-1945</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">With the outbreak of war, Shockley worked on military projects, particularly refining radar systems. After the war, he began investigating semiconductors.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1947-1948</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley's team, comprised of Bardeen and Brattain, invented the first transistor without him. However, in a fit of frustration after being excluded, he followed up 9 days later with a second version which was far easier to produce.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1955</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley left Bell Labs and founded <b>Shockley Semiconductors</b>, the first semiconductor factory in the soon-to-be Silicon Valley. The company ultimately failed due to social issues within the company.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1956</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley, along with his colleagues Bardeen and Brattain, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1963-1975</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">After the failure of Shockley Semiconductors, Shockley was appointed as Professor of Engineering at Stanford University, until his retirement in 1975.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1989</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley passed away at the age of 79.</p>
